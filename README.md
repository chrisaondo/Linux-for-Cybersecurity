# Linux Portfolio

Welcome to my Linux Portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects, scripts, and notes based on a comprehensive course covering Linux fundamentals, system administration, and automation. The goal is to demonstrate practical skills, understanding of core concepts, and readiness for DevOps, SRE, and system administrator roles.
